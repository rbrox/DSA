**Study Instructions:**

1. **Group Formation:**
   - Divide into three groups, Group A, Group B, and Group C.

2. **Study Schedule:**
   - Group A will follow the study schedule as provided in the original plan.
   - Group B will study in the reverse order of the original plan, starting with the last activity and progressing backward.
   - Group C will follow a modified order, starting with the second activity, then the third, and finally the first activity.

3. **Group Study Session:**
   - After each pomodoro session, gather for a group study session.
   - Each group will discuss 2-3 questions from the assigned set.
   - Focus on sharing insights and discussing the approach to implementing solutions.
   - Encourage active participation and collaboration within the group.

By following this approach, each group will cover the same topics but in a different order, allowing for varied perspectives and deeper understanding of the material.
